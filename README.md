# gwt-redux
GWT Java bindings for Redux and Redux related projects

##Introduction

gwt-redux provides Java [GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org/) bindings based on the
new JsInterop capabilities introduced in GWT 2.8 for the following Redux related projects:

* [redux 3.4.0](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
* [react-redux 4.4.5](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux)
* [redux-undo 1.0.0 beta](https://github.com/omnidan/redux-undo)

This project depends on [gwt-react](https://github.com/GWTReact/gwt-react)

***Please note: the project currently only works with a Snapshot build of GWT 2.8. Consider this project a preview. The API is only partially complete at this point and is highly likely to change.***

##Getting Started

Please take a look at the [gwt-react-examples](https://github.com/GWTReact/gwt-react-examples) project for
details on how to use the library.

##Roadmap

* Finish the api
* Provide API's for the popular middleware
